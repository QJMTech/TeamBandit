A revolutionary course management portal which combines every element of communication, administration, delegation, and organization to provide a seamless platform for teaching professional skills in the environment most practical to the modern workforce— in a team.

This web-based application serves as an educational turning point from the inadequacy of modern University-level industry preparation. Collaboration has become a cornerstone of every professional field: technology, administration, healthcare, business, engineering, and every branching variation.

# The Motive

Gone are the days in which individuals being bombarded with tasks of short-term memorization and regurgitation would be considered an investment into their professional value. Productive society has recognized and embraced the strength brought about by complementary action among skilled, coordinated colleagues. It is indisputable that effective teamwork serves as an imperative pillar of reaching any worthwhile goal in the face of today's competitive markets that never sleep. Team experience and skills are the single most widely sought after traits for candidates of employment.

Why then, do the overwhelming majority of higher education programs center their curriculums around mind-numbing lectures and individual recollection of unapplied facts? The unfortunate reality is that courses focused on taking knowledge and applying it realistically involves an exhausting amount of organization and management. It involves communication among many parties of varying roles, keeping track of individual progress within a collective within the whole, and trying to maintain consistency across the board. This immense overhead has made it impractical to educate pragmatically— until now.

# The Vision

TeamBandit: an online application designed specifically to automate and organize on behalf of instructors intending to prepare their students for the world they are entering. All of the tedious overhead is taken care of.

***Organization***, with an integrated email forwarding system;  
***Control***, with distinctly-priveleged account types and administrative flexibility;  
***Simplicity***, with drag-and-drop data implementation;  
***Focus***, with full separation of courses; and  
***Assessment***, with automatically-generated websites for showcasing student teams' growth and achievements.

Every tool is neatly combined into a single application, providing the ultimate all-in-one control panel for course organizers to make education reflect reality.
